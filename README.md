## **JEAP is Now Official: A New Chapter Begins**

Welcome to the official repository for **JEAP** — the **Justice, Education, and Advancement Project** — now legally registered and fully recognized as an association under the laws of the **Republic of Cameroon**.

For many years, JEAP members have walked side by side with **Joan’s Nursery and Primary School** — giving time, resources, prayers, and heartfelt commitment. Until now, much of this work has been behind the scenes. Today, we celebrate a new chapter in our shared journey.
